        <p>Intellectual property rights (IPR) refer to the legal rights granted to individuals or organizations for their creations or inventions stemming from human intellect and creativity. These rights are designed to protect and provide exclusive control over intangible assets, allowing creators to benefit from their work and incentivizing further innovation and creativity. Intellectual property encompasses a range of creative and innovative works, including inventions, artistic creations, literary works, symbols, designs, names, logos, and trade secrets.</p>
        <p>There are several types of intellectual property rights:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Copyright:</h3> Copyright protects original literary, artistic, musical, and dramatic works. It grants the creator the exclusive rights to reproduce, distribute, display, perform, and modify their work for a specific duration of time.</li>
            <li><h3>Trademarks:</h3> Trademarks protect distinctive signs, symbols, logos, or words used to identify and distinguish goods or services of one party from those of others. They help prevent confusion and maintain brand reputation.</li>
            <li><h3>Patents:</h3> Patents grant exclusive rights to inventors for new and useful inventions. Patents provide protection for a limited period, during which the inventor has the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, or importing the patented invention.</li>
            <li><h3>Trade Secrets:</h3> Trade secrets are confidential and proprietary information, such as formulas, processes, customer lists, or marketing strategies, which provide a competitive advantage to businesses.</li>
